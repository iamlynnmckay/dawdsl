# dawdsl

`dawdsl` is a domain specific language framework for digital audio workstations and other computer music technologies. 

For users, it offers a language for music composition that is intuitive to read, easy to write, expressive enough for most any type of music, and specific enough to be useful for musicians.

For developers, it offers an extensible platform on which to build domain specific languages in JSON, with modular compiler and interpreter units composed together in layers of transformation and interaction.

For everyone else, it offers nothing.

`dawdsl` is still in its early days, with an initial release planned for 2023. For now, this codebase is totally and completely fucked (sorry not sorry).
